# Random Forest Playground

This is me playing around with Random Forest models, mostly on Kaggle data sets. It is based on learnings from the FastAI course "Intro to ML For Coders". Because I am using that older course, I am using the fastai 0.7.x version of the library rather than the newer 1.x. All this code assumes the presence of a symlink `fastai` in the root of the repo that points to the fastai 0.7.x code (located at `fastai/old/fastai` in the fastai github repo).
